# Challenge Owner Guide

The [Standards Hub](https://github.com/alphagov/-and-data-standards) lets anyone get involved in the process of prioritising and helping us to select open standards for government IT. It also gives information on how we select open standards.

## Who’s involved in selecting open standards

The groups of people involved and what they do

## Users

Our users include people from businesses, academic institutions, charities, not-for-profit  and government bodies (UK and international). Some are primarily interested in how to transact with government easily. Many also have expertise in designing or building software and data/information management solutions. They are people who have an interest in building on open standards that make different types of software and data compatible with each other.

Users are involved at each phase of the selection and implementation of open standards for government IT. As a challenge owner, you need to have an understanding of who your users are and what they need.

You should be in contact and encouraging involvement with users throughout the duration of the selection process.

## Government technology officials

A group of government technology officials seek user needs based challenges that open standards might help to resolve - these technology officials are drawn from standards panels. They agree which of these challenges we should work on, making sure that there is a challenge owner in place who has the resource to lead the work through to completion. That’s where you come in.

Government technology officials may include technology leaders. These are the people in government who are responsible for delivering technology that meets the needs of service users and people who work in the department. They are responsible for implementing adopted standards profiles, which are the outcome of the Standards Hub process.

## Challenge Owners

Challenge owners are suggested by the group of government technology officials and are appointed by the the open standards team with the approval of whoever owns the process .You lead the work to engage with users, develop proposals, carry out assessments and research relating to standards, and draft standards profiles in response to the challenge. You work closely with and take recommendations to and from a standards panel. 

## Standards Panel

The Open Standards Team draws groups of expert users together to form the open standards panel. These people may be from government or not-for-profit organisations, in addition to other experts who are selected following a public call for volunteers. 

The Panel works with challenge owners to appraise proposals and advise the Open Standards Board on how they meet the needs described in a challenge.

## Open Standards Board

The Open Standards Board aims to choose set of standards that are to be applied consistently across the UK government to make services better for users and to keep government IT costs sustainable.

The Open Standards Board is formed of expert users drawn from government and not-for-profit organisations in addition to volunteers from academia and industry. They consider open standards recommendations from standards panels, making decisions on whether they:

* demonstrate that they meet user need and business outcomes
* enable a level playing field for open source and proprietary software
* are implementable, mature and supported by the market
* have been adequately researched and that the impact of adoption is understood
* support open data and are aligned with the Open Standards Principles and the Government’s IT/digital strategies.

## How We Select Open Standards

There are four phases in our approach to selecting and implementing open standards in government IT.

## Suggestion Stage

We’re trying to find out what problems users of government services face that open standards can help to fix. 

The first stage of this is asking users for suggestions on what these problems are. Just a few sentences about what the problem is, what the needs are and what the benefits might be is enough to get us started. The suggestion may also recommend a particular standard be adopted to meet a user need in government IT.

The Triage Panel, a group of technology officers in government consider these suggestions and look at the benefits that these might deliver. They may decide to take up the suggestion. If they do, they’ll work with the Open Standards team to identify and appoint someone to take it forward - a challenge owner.

## What challenge owners should do during the suggestions phase

There is no specific role for you at this stage as no challenge owner will yet have been appointed. However, as someone with an interest in the area, you might want to keep an eye on the Standards Hub for any suggestions that relate to your expertise.

You could suggest a challenge or comment on an existing suggested challenge. You may also want to get in touch if you’d like us to consider you as a potential challenge owner if a particular suggested challenge is taken forward.

## Response phase

When you have agreed to take up a challenge, the Open Standards Team will publish the live challenge on the Standards Hub, so that users can respond with ideas. You can see an example of a challenge on the Standards Hub.

## What you should do during the Response phase
With the help of the Open Standards Team…

* Agree a window of time for responses and comments. We’ll need to publish a closing date on the Standards Hub to let everyone know when the challenge phase will end. We suggest around 4 weeks from when the challenge is published.
* Draft the challenge based on the suggestions received through the Standards Hub and feedback from the government technology officials who reviewed the suggestions. You should write in plain English using the Government Digital Service [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/content-designers/transactions-style-guide.html) and should focus on the user needs that the challenge is addressing. Publish the challenge.
* Identify your users and your stakeholders and investigate the best channels you can use to reach them.
* Seek and encourage responses to your challenge through the channels you’ve identified. Ask for ideas about how to fix the problem. For instance, which open standards should we use?
* Monitor responses submitted to the Standards Hub and engage with your users by commenting on and debating ideas. If they ask for clarification, provide it if you are able to at this stage - it may be something that can only be answered as your work progresses. If so, let them know that.
* Plan pilots, workshops, working groups, testing or any other events that you might need to inform the next phases of your work.
* Consider whether you have enough material to develop proposals. Carry out any further research you might need and address any clarifications or refinements relating to the scope or the needs published in the challenge. 
* Consider whether the standards suggested meet the UK government [definition](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles#open-standard---definition) of open standards for us in government IT. 
* You may seek advice from the Open Standards Team and the standards panel


## Propose phase

:--- | --- |

You will then need to consider the responses youve received to the challenge, in addition to your own research, pulling together some options to develop further. These are known as proposals. You could prepare more than one proposal if there are several ideas that you think might work. 

You can see an example of a proposal on the Standards Hub - it should describe the approach you are suggesting and the standards that are needed in that context. There is also a [guide](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-and-data-standards/blob/master/docs/writing%20a%20proposal.md) to help with writing a proposal.


## What you should do during the propose phase 

* Assessing the standards within your proposal(s). This should be based on the list of core questions. You have the option to suggest to the Board that some of the questions are not applicable for the proposal(s) associated with your challenge. The Open Standards Team will lead in assessing the standards and will confer with you.
* Form working groups if required. Invite experts to events that you have planned. The Open Standards Team can provide you with contact details for any Hub users who have been involved in the online discussion about your challenge, if they have indicated a willingness to get more involved. Be clear with them about what your are expecting in terms of tasks and the time they might need to commit.
* Publish a note of any events/meetings and declarations of interest from attendees. These notes should be concise and written in plain English using the Government Digital Service style guide.

Once you have defined the proposals you will need to research them in detail, assessing the proposed standards, and investigating if the approach meets the needs set out in the challenge. The standards panel will evaluate your work and submit their findings to the Open Standards Board, which will make the final decision on whether to accept a recommendation. 

In exceptional circumstances, if you are unable to resolve a difference of opinion with the standards panel on the recommendation that should be made to the Open Standards Board, you may reject the standards panel’s advice. If this happens, both you and a chair of the standards panel will be able to present at an Open Standards Board meeting where both opinions will be considered.


## Before the standards panel meet

* Analyse your research, the outcomes of any events or pilots you have run and your assessments of standards.
* If you began with more than one proposal and later decide that some are less likely to meet the needs described in the challenge, you may choose to focus on fewer proposals. You should seek advice from the standards panel if you are considering this and publish your reasoning on the Standards Hub.
* Work with the standards panel to evaluate your proposal(s). Your response to a set of evaluation questions and the proposed recommendation, once it has been agreed with the standards panel, will be published on the Standards Hub. If the standards panel does not agree to submit your recommendation, they may ask you to carry out more research, returning to an earlier stage of the process.
* Publish a draft standards proposal. Include the open standards that you are recommending. 

## Implementation phase

## What you should do during the implementation phase

* Encourage government bodies to implement the agreed standards profile.
* Provide guidance for technology leaders who are responsible for implementation.
* Along with other users, you can report through the Standards Hub if there are any issues with the adopted standards profile.
