# Challenge Owner Guide

The [Standards Hub](https://github.com/alphagov/-and-data-standards) lets anyone get involved in the process of prioritising and helping us to select open standards for government IT. It also gives information on how we select open standards.

## Who’s involved in selecting open standards

The groups of people involved and what they do

## Users

Our users include people from businesses, academic institutions, charities, not-for-profit  and government bodies (UK and international). Some are primarily interested in how to transact with government easily. Many also have expertise in designing or building software and data/information management solutions. They are people who have an interest in building on open standards that make different types of software and data compatible with each other.

Users are involved at each phase of the selection and implementation of open standards for government IT. As a challenge owner, you need to have an understanding of who your users are and what they need.

You should be in contact and encouraging involvement with users throughout the duration of the selection process.

## Government technology officials

A group of government technology officials seek user needs based challenges that open standards might help to resolve - these technology officials are drawn from standards panels. They agree which of these challenges we should work on, making sure that there is a challenge owner in place who has the resource to lead the work through to completion. That’s where you come in.

Government technology officials may include technology leaders. These are the people in government who are responsible for delivering technology that meets the needs of service users and people who work in the department. They are responsible for implementing adopted standards profiles, which are the outcome of the Standards Hub process.

## Challenge Owners

Challenge owners are suggested by the group of government technology officials and are appointed by the the open standards team with the approval of whoever owns the process .You lead the work to engage with users, develop proposals, carry out assessments and research relating to standards, and draft standards profiles in response to the challenge. You work closely with and take recommendations to and from a standards panel. 

## Standards Panel

The Open Standards Team draws groups of expert users together to form the open standards panel. These people may be from government or not-for-profit organisations, in addition to other experts who are selected following a public call for volunteers. 

The Panel works with challenge owners to appraise proposals and advise the Open Standards Board on how they meet the needs described in a challenge.

## Open Standards Board

The Open Standards Board aims to choose set of standards that are to be applied consistently across the UK government to make services better for users and to keep government IT costs sustainable.

The Open Standards Board is formed of expert users drawn from government and not-for-profit organisations in addition to volunteers from academia and industry. They consider open standards recommendations from standards panels, making decisions on whether they:

* demonstrate that they meet user need and business outcomes
* enable a level playing field for open source and proprietary software
* are implementable, mature and supported by the market
* have been adequately researched and that the impact of adoption is understood
* support open data and are aligned with the Open Standards Principles and the Government’s IT/digital strategies.

## How We Select Open Standards

There are four phases in our approach to selecting and implementing open standards in government IT.
