# Markdown cheatsheet for tech-and-data-standards

Being a quick and easy guide for the team to write content.

## Pages

All filenames *must* have a `.md` extension.  For example, this page is `help.md`.

All filenames *must* be lower-case.

## Linking

### Internal Linking

There are two ways you can link to *internal* content.  Either with or without the file extension.

* `This is a link to [Home](home)`.  This is the preferred way.
* `This is a link to [home](home.md)`.

The bit in `[]` is what the user sees, the bit in `()` is where it links to.

The links are case sensitive.  All filenames *must* be lower-case.

### External Linking

* `This is an [external link](https://example.com/)`

### Within a page

It is possible to link to a specific part of a page.

To link to the "Internal Linking" section of this document, create a link to the heading title - for example `[find out more about Internal Links](#internal-linking)`.

To link to a specific section of a different page, `[read the assessment questiosn for challenge owners](challenge-owners#core-assessment-questions)`
