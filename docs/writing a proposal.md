## What is a proposal?

A document that is published on the Hub and presented to the Standards Panel and Board. The proposal states which standards have been chosen by a challenge owner and how the standards meets the user needs of the challenge, its benefits and functional needs. When a proposal is published Hub users can make comments on it for a set period of time, usually a month. A proposal should contain enough detail to act as the basis of a guide for adopting the standard.

Standards proposals develop as a challenge moves through the process, incorporating suggestions from Hub contributors, the Standards Panel and the Board. The final version is called a Profile and is publised on [GOV.UK] (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government) See examples of proposal here <link to new hub proposals folder>

## Sections in the proposal

The 5 sections of the proposal explain the approach to be taken to meet the needs in a challenge by adopting a standard.

### Introduction:

A short summary of how this approach or standard would address the challenge and what the outcome of adopting the standards would be. (on the original hub the word limit for the introduction is set to 900 characters)

### User need approach:

How the proposed standard would address the user need described in the challenge. 
Include who the users of this standard are and what their specific needs are.       

Example: Users in the context of this proposal include citizens, businesses and delivery partners who need to share information with government in editable formats.

### Achieving the expected benefits:

How this approach would aim to realise the benefits for users, and the operational, social or environmental benefits that the challenge describes.
Explain the outcomes that would be achieved for the challenge to solved.

Example text:

* the improved quality in data would have an economic benefit as …
* a standard format will allow users to easily share and add this information….
* this saves operational cost in detecting and fixing errors in the text, and provides more accurate information.

### Functional needs:

Explain how the standards addresses the functional needs that the challenge describes.

Example: URLs can easily be resolved to information about the thing identified... within browsers and with other tools

### Other steps to achieving interoperability:

A summary of any additional legal, semantic or operational issues that you think we need to address.

Example: Existing documents should be migrated to the formats specified in this proposal if they are re-opened for editing or are requested by a user.


## Changes required for the profile

The last version of the proposal which is approved by the board is re-written as a profile.
The wording changes - removing mention of proposal and using precise terms see examples [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government) and in this [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) document.
