The standards hub has been created to allow your engagement and feedback on government standards. We want the information on this site to be open and as easy to access as possible.

By using this site you agree to comply with the following rules, ensuring you remain able to make published submissions and that all hub visitors get the best out of this process.

When you submit proposals to this site you are encouraged to:

*   Make proposals against the challenges set
*   Return to maintain/edit proposals after they have been submitted
*   Review and engage with the views of other contributors, as expressed by the overall set of published proposals, helping to derive new proposals which continue to embrace the current challenge set
*   Review the standards catalogue over time

## You must:

*   Be respectful of the contributions made by other users of this hub
*   Ensure your proposals are as complete as possible
*   Ensure your proposal can clearly be seen to address the challenge to which it relates
*   Include relevant web links, as necessary, to documents or references which support or help define your proposal
*   Update your proposals as relevant influencing factors change.

## You must not:

*   Make any personal or professional references which might reasonably be considered inappropriate, defamatory or misleading
*   Include information which cannot be proven to be correct or which unfairly represents a government or other public body’s stance
*   Reference personal individuals names or details without their prior consent
*   Use this site to advertise commercial services or businesses of any type
*   Use this site for party political purposes. This site is funded with public money - it is not appropriate to engage in party-political activity here
*   Use these materials in or to support a criminal or illicit activity
*   Use these materials on an application to inflame or make comments that are racist, sexist or homophobic, or which promote or incite violence or illegal activity

The standards hub is in part self-policing with all participants able to request the removal of any comments they deem inappropriate. The standards hub’s administrators will carefully review any of these requests and also reserve the right to remove any proposals that are unsuitable. Individuals whose contributions are impacted will be contacted directly.

## Prohibited Actions

You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from the website any material:

*   that is threatening, defamatory, obscene, indecent, seditious, offensive, pornographic, abusive, liable to incite racial hatred, discriminatory, menacing, scandalous, inflammatory, blasphemous, in breach of confidence, in breach of privacy or which may cause annoyance or inconvenience; or
*   for which you have not obtained all necessary licences and/or approvals; or
*   which constitutes or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offence, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise be contrary to the law of or infringe the rights of any third party, in any country in the world; or
*   which is technically harmful (including, without limitation, computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software or harmful data).

## Usage of Contributions

The information you send may need to be passed to colleagues within, or working on behalf of, the Cabinet Office or other government departments and may be published in full or in a summary of responses. Comments made online will be visible to anyone visiting the site but will be subject to moderation before they are published.

All information in responses, including personal information, may also be subject to publication or disclosure in accordance with the access to information regimes (these are primarily the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004). If you want your response to remain private, you should explain why confidentiality is necessary and your request will be acceded to only if it is appropriate in the circumstances. An automatic confidentiality disclaimer generated by your IT system will not, of itself, be regarded as binding on the department.
