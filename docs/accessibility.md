Standards.data.gov.uk is committed to making this website accessible to all users, regardless of circumstances. We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of the site; if you have any questions or suggestions regarding the accessibility of this site, or if you have difficulty using any part of it, please [contact us](contact).

## Standards compliance

We are working towards ensuring that all pages on this site comply with priority 2 guidelines of the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php). Whilst data.gov.uk strives to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. We are continually seeking out solutions that will bring all areas of the site up to the same level of overall accessibility.

## How do I make the text bigger so that it is easier for me to read?

Some users might find screen text easier to read by increasing the size at which text is displayed. To do this you should simply adjust your browser’s settings.

*   Using Chrome, go to View > Zoom In
*   Using Firefox, go to View, select Zoom and then either Increase Ctrl + +, Decrease Ctrl + – or Normal Ctrl + 0
*   Using Internet Explorer, go to View > Text size - and select the size you want
*   Using Safari, go to View > Zoom In or if you just want to zoom in on text but not images go to View, select Zoom Text Only then View > Zoom In
*   Using Opera, View > Zoom - and select the size you want

## What are PDFs and how do I read them?

We will do our best to avoid adding documents to this site. Our preference will be to display all the information as web pages. However, sometimes it may not be possible and we will have to add documents that you can download. These may be PDFs. PDF stands for Portable Document File. You need a plug-in called Adobe Acrobat Reader to view these files which you can download for free from [Adobe’s website](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html).

Users who have concerns about accessibility should visit [Adobe’s accessibility website](http://access.adobe.com/). Recent versions of Acrobat Reader have a Read Out Loud facility, which can be found under the View menu.
