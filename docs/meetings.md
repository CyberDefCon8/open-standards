The Board met to consider:

1. Proposals for two challenges :
 *  public emergency alert messaging
 * publishing vacancies online
2. A redrafted challenge for understanding government information.
3. A fast track in the open standards process for certain standards.

#### Summary of outcomes:

The board agreed that:

1. The recommendation by the challenge owners that a UK profile for the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) should not be developed. That guidance to be produced instead by the implementing bodies was acceptable if conditions set by the Board are met.

3. The redrafted understanding government information challenge is ready to go through the open standards process.
4. The fast track process should be used for standards that are deemed eligible.

### [2015-11-13 Open Standards Board](2015-11-13-open-standards-board)

The board met to consider:

1. recommendations on four proposals:
  * exchange of property/place information
  * exchange of location point information
  * multi agency incident transfer
  * publishing vacancies online
2. the adoption of a fast track process for selecting open standards in some circumstances

### Summary of outcomes

The board agreed that the:

1. Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) should not be adopted as an open standard. Instead, the Board proposed the development of an open register of addressable locations to meet the user need.
2. The European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) must be used as mandated by the INSPIRE directive. For the rest of the world the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) must be adopted. The Board also agreed that other coordinate standards may be used, in addition to WGS 84/ETRS89, where they more readily suit the user need, e.g. greater accuracy required for precision engineering decisions.
3. The Multi Agency Incident Transfer (MAIT) proposal should be adopted subject to clarification for the board of the suitability of the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License to be applied to XML schema.
4. The standard identified publishing vacancies online cannot be considered for adoption until the board has further clarification on several points relating to the proposal.
5. The board shall discuss the fast track process for open standards by audio conference in the second week of December paper.

### [2015-10-23 Data Panel meeting](2015-10-23-data-panel-meeting)
This meeting was scheduled to evaluate the following proposals:

*   Multi agency incident transfer (MAIT): Multi Agency Incident Transfer Version 0.2.2
*   Exchange of location point information: World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84)
*   Exchange of property / place address information: Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN).

#### Summary of outcomes

The Data Panel agreed that:Â 

1. MAIT could be recommended to the Open Standards Board once legal questions had been resolved.
2. the proposed solution for exchange of location point information (WGS84) could be recommended to the Board once drafting issues identified by the Panel had been resolved.
3. questions remained about UPRN, its status and how it relates to the adopted solution for persistent resolvable identifiers. More work was needed before a proposal on the exchange of property and place information could be taken to the Board.

### [2015-10-22 Data Panel meeting](2015-10-22-data-panel-meeting)

This meeting was held to evaluate the following proposals:

*   Publishing vacancies online: JobPosting v2.1
*   Multi agency incident transfer (MAIT): Multi Agency Incident Transfer Version 0.2.2

#### Summary of outcomes

The Data panel:

1. agreed that JobPosting 2.1 should be put forward to the Open Standards Board as a recommended rather than compulsory open standard for publishing vacancies online, once revisions have been made to the proposal.
2. deferred discussion of MAIT 0.2.2 to the next Panel meeting.

### [2015-04-13 Data Panel meeting](2015-04-13-data-panel-meeting)

The panel evaluated proposals on language tags and country codes at this meeting. Paul Downey of GDS acted as challenge owner for these proposals and presented them to the panel.

***

### [2015-04-27 Open Standards Board](2015-04-27-open-standards-board)

This was the fifth Open Standards Board, two proposals were tabled for discussion:

1. Language tags
1. Country codes

A revised challenge on understanding government documents was also tabled. The Open Standards Board had previously asked for clarity on the scope and user need when they had been asked to review a proposal on this topic.

#### Summary of outcomes

The Board agreed:

1. Understanding government documents is a good challenge to take through the process. The scope of the proposed challenge needs to be refined to clearly describe the user needs and two streams of work, one addressing the data elements and the other the vocabularies.
2. The secretariat should investigate copyright of ISO standards and their general interrelationship with IETF specifications. It should also investigate putting a request to ISO for them to consider making language tags and country codes publicly available specifications.
3. Subject to requested changes to the proposals, ISO 3166-1:2013 and ISO 639-1:2002 must be used in new systems handling data or web content that requires language tags or country codes.
