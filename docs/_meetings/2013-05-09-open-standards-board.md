## Context

This was the first meeting of the newly formed Open Standards Board. Liam thanked all of the members for volunteering their time and their expertise for the public good, highlighting that their efforts will have a massive impact on people’s lives and potentially save millions of pounds in public money.

## Summary of outcomes

The Board agreed:

1.  The [process](http://www.slideshare.net/DigEngHMG/open-standards-board-standards-selection-process) for how we should select open standards
2.  That we should use the [assessment criteria](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/idabc-camss/index.php/CAMSS_Assessment_Criteria) in the European Common Assessment Methodology for Standards and Specifications as a starting point for the criteria advisory panels and challenge owners will use when assessing challenge proposals
3.  The [terms of reference](board-terms) for the Board
4.  To meet again in July and in September

## Declarations of interest

Before each meeting attendees are asked to declare any interests relating to the topics being covered. The following interests were declared:

1.  Liam Maxwell noted that he was required to declare his investments to the Cabinet Secretary when he was appointed. He has no direct technology company investments.
2.  Nicholas Oughtibridge, a guest at the meeting and presenting on the proposed standards selection process declared that he is employed by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which is a standards development organisation.

## Discussion topic 1: The standards selection process

Nicholas Oughtibridge was former chair of a Shadow Data Standards Panel which operated for a few months to test out our proposed standards panel approach. [Nicholas presented](http://www.slideshare.net/DigEngHMG/open-standards-board-standards-selection-process) a view of what had been learned during the trial of the process and described the key roles and activities.

There was discussion about the levers and resources needed to take a standard through the journey from challenge to implemented standard. Standards panels will work with challenge owners to make sure there is a credible plan in place to resource the development of proposals.

The Board concluded that the process was suitably broad to work in the various contexts that it will need to operate in across government and is flexible to the needs of how projects are run and funded.

One of the key challenges that the Board raised was the issue of encouraging people to engage in the discussion, particularly online. They considered that face to face engagement was important for encouraging the debate through the Standards Hub.

## Discussion topic 2: The assessment criteria

[Linda presented](http://www.slideshare.net/DigEngHMG/open-standards-board-assessment-criteria "Assessment criteria presentation") the proposed criteria for assessing the standards. The board considered that understanding the context of implementation of the standard and where it is already in use could be important information in assessing its suitability. This should be reflected in the selection criteria. They were also keen to make sure that backwards compatibility was considered.

As well as assessing the proposed open standards, the Board asked that the proposals consider threats: what might be on the horizon that could derail the implementation or the standard itself?

The Board agreed to adopt the [assessment criteria](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/idabc-camss/index.php/CAMSS_Assessment_Criteria) described in the Common Assessment Methodology for Standards and Specifications as a foundation for us to build on and amend. The questions should not be a fixed set. They agreed that the assessment criteria and knock-out criteria may be different for each challenge but that these should be published in advance of the assessment being carried out. Knock out criteria are those to which a ‘no’ answer would mean that the standard was not suitable and would not be considered further.

For the first challenges to pass through the Open Standards Board, the Board opted to agree the criteria that will be used for each of the assessments. Patterns are likely to emerge and in time the panels may take over this responsibility.

The selection criteria and the process itself will be iterative. The Board will consider the lessons learned from using these for the first challenges and then evaluate and re-set the criteria and the process after the first challenges have passed through the process.

The Board reflected that the answers to the assessment questions will not provide a yes/no answer of whether a standard should be adopted. They are the starting point for a more nuanced assessment that balances different aspects, for instance the assessment of risk against the maturity of a standard. Standards panels will need to consider these aspects when submitting their recommendation briefings to the Board.

## Discussion topic 3: Formation of the standards panels

The Board noted the diversity in how standards come into being particularly when international factors are taken into account, for example Health works very differently to Justice or Home Affairs. The Board felt that it was important that the panels reflect this diversity.

The Board considered that commitment, time, experience and a drive to deliver are all important factors in appointing chairs to the panels.

Nicholas Oughtibridge was put forward by Cabinet Office as a candidate for the chair of the Data Standards Panel. The Board endorsed his appointment.

Cabinet Office will seek to find chairs for the document and technical standards panels. Once the chairs are appointed, Cabinet Office will work with them to seek volunteers from diverse backgrounds to join the panels. The Board asked that the panels be dynamic, with people joining and leaving according to the topics being covered. They stipulated that anyone should be able to volunteer to join these groups. Cabinet Office will identify users of the Standards Hub who have signed-up to be considered for further face to face working to look for potential candidates.

## Discussion topic 4: Terms of reference

The Board was supportive of the proposed [terms](board-terms), which have now been adopted. Board working should be transparent. The preference is to do this through the Standards Hub or a public mailing list.
