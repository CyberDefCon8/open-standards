The Board met to consider:

1. Proposals for two challenges :
   * public emergency alert messaging
   * publishing vacancies online
2. A redrafted challenge for understanding government information.
3. A fast track in the open standards process for certain standards.

## Summary of outcomes:

The board agreed that:

1. The recommendation by the challenge owners that a UK profile for the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) should not be developed. That guidance to be produced instead by the implementing bodies was acceptable if conditions set by the Board are met.
2. The JobPosting schema must be used when jobs are advertised by government online.
3. The redrafted understanding government information challenge is ready to go through the open standards process.
4. The fast track process should be used for standards that are deemed eligible.

## Declarations of interest:

The board was invited to declare any interests; none were raised.

## Public emergency alert messaging

The Board discussed how CAP differs from the Multi Agency Incident Transfer (MAIT) standard. The challenge owner explained that CAP is used in alert messages sent to the public from agencies such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). MAIT is intended for communicating between emergency responders.

Board agreed in the [October 2014 meeting](2014-09-22-open-standards-board) that a UK profile for CAP 1.2 should be defined. The challenge owners explained in a report to the Board that they now recommend *against* a UK profile. The purpose of existing CAP profiles is to constrain the national CAP messages to the requirements of existing alert systems.

Instead of a national profile the civil contingencies secretariat (CCS) should stand up a committee of UK alert issuing bodies. This committee would formulate and propagate best practice for alert messages based on experience.

The Board debated the need for a specific UK profile. It was decided that although there was some merit in limiting the standard’s profile, for example in preferring XML over ASN.1 coding, overall decisions on which elements are used should be left to the implementers in a forum convened by the CCS

During the discussion a member pointed to the CAP IPR statement on the OASIS website. The CAP technical council operates under the RF on RAND Mode of the OASIS IPR Policy, but a notice from a company (Azos) claimed a patent ‘essential to the compliant implementation’ of CAP giving non-exclusive rights but no mention of royalty free license. The board decided that this issue would need to be clarified before the standard could be adopted by government.

### Action 1.
The challenge owner and the secretariat to work with CCS on the creation of a UK alert issuing bodies forum.

### Action 2.
The secretariat to seek clarification of the IPR statement on the OASIS website from the OASIS TC

## Redrafted challenge for understanding government information

The data panel chairman presented the redraft of this challenge which in another form had previously reached the suggestion stage in the Open Standards Process. The original challenge was judged by Board at the [April 2015 meeting](2015-04-27-open-standards-board) as too wide in its scope.

The newly drafted challenge was accepted by the Board to go through the process with its more clearly defined user need. Members suggested that the title of the challenge could be revised to include archival and retrieval and that the meaning of documents in this case should be defined.

### Action 3
The secretariat to work with the challenge owner to revise the title and define what is meant by documents in the challenge text.

## Publishing Vacancies Online

In the [November 2015 board](2015-11-13-open-standards-board) discussed the schema.org JobPosting schema. This was thought to meet a user need in government for improving job adverts online. The governance of the standards body did not meet the Board’s definition of open however. The chair took an action to write to schema.org’s steering group requesting that it align its processes with the assessment used on the Standards Hub.

The board has since received a reply from Dan Brickley of the steering group. The board agreed that this reply went a long way in satisfying the Open Standards Principle of transparency. As a result the Board recommended that the standard be adopted for use in online vacancy advertisements.

It was noted that this was a success for the Board as it was able to influence change in the governance of a standards body.

## The Fast Track Process

The Board heard an outline for a fast track within the open standards process. Suggested for use with mature standards proposals. The fast track responds to a perception that the open standards process duplicates effort in mature proposals where there are already well proven use cases. The fast track would allow mature suggestions to start at the 'proposal' stage with a standard ready for assessment. For challenges with an already identified standard the ‘Suggestion’ and ‘Response’ phases would be combined.

Both approaches allow for public debate and the same level of assessment as already in use.

It was also suggested that the data and technical panels be combined to make better use of the skills of the panels members.

The Board agreed that the fast track can be used when a challenge meets the criteria of having a mature proposal. Members clarified that mature in this sense can apply to both the standard and the use of the standard in government.

The Board noted that changes will need to be made to Standards Hub to enable the fast track process.

A member mentioned at this stage a related process item of legal issues that need to be taken into account by the process before the Board can approve a standard as open and for use in government.

### Action 4.
Secretariat to identify the changes required to the Standards Hub to enable the fast track process.

### Action 5.
Chris Francis to list issues in the process that may be missed by the CAMSS and Technical review.

## AOB

The next meeting is planned to be in November 2016

If members have questions that need to be answered in the meeting they should in future put them forward before the meeting.

The Chair brought to the attention of the Board a communication from the EC; ‘Standardisation Priorities for the Digital Single Market’ that contained the statement that ‘ICT standardisation requires a balanced IPR policy, based on FRAND licensing terms.’
