The Panel requested that James Penman and the team need to produce a UK profile for CAP which needs to include the following:

*   Guidance on signing the message
*   Consider only permitting XML encoding (excluding ASN.1 due to issues raised by CESG)
*   ensure that police are involved in the process (James confirmed that Charlotte Lawrence was already working on this point)
*   ensure that issues around the devolved governments are appropriately considered (James agreed CCS would check on issues)

The Board agreed to receive an outline of the process we propose for this work by the end of the week, as well as providing a commitment to approach the police and devolved governments ( if not actual evidence of progress).   
James also agreed to provide a list of stakeholders we have already approached or intend to approach for inclusion in the process for generating the profile,

The above is attached in the meeting annex.

## The following people attended the meeting:

* Magnus Falk, Government Digital Services (chair)
* Nicholas Oughtibridge, Health and Social Care Information Centre
* James Stewart - Government Digital Services
* John Adams - Department for International Development
* Richard Crowther - CESG
* Tariq Rashid - Home Office
* James Penman - Met Office
* Steven Walters - HMRC


## Post meeting note

In terms of CCS contact with the DA’s and with the Police- both groups have been involved in our alerting work and will be represented on the working group to ensure their views are included as we develop the UK profile of CAP.

The team has ACPO representation confirmed and will be speaking to colleagues in the Scottish and Welsh Government this week to confirm who specifically will be involved.
