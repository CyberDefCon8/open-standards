## Declaration of interests

## Open Contracting Data Standard OCDS

The Challenge owner introduced the the Open Contracting data schema to the panel.

The aim of adopting this standard is to improve the quality of the public sector contract data published and supply it in a machine readable format. An initiative by the World Bank created the standard. The standard is becoming more popular. Governments around the are world committing to publishing data using OCDS, including the UK government as part of the Open Government National Action Plan.

The Chair asked if the standard was already in use anywhere. The challenge owner advised that governments including the governments of of Mexico and Uruguay have implemented and that OCDS is also used for data in extraction and mining. The OCDS web site provides details of other use cases. The UK has committed to starting using the data by October this year.

The Panel asked if there was access to the project schedule and budget for the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) implementation of OCDS. The reply given was that the steering group publish these in their minutes. The challenge owner had not seen these though offered to present if required.

Asked whether there would be exceptions for sensitive contracts involving national security, the challenge owner answered that the commitment did not state particular exceptions. The panel agreed that the freedom of information act applied to such contracts and the data would not be published. The legal framework is in place to determine which data are published. This should be stated in the standard profile.

The panel noted that there is a need to publish data on Contract Finder now and asked if there is a plan to fit this with OCDS. The challenge owner replied that this is part of the CCS Plan. OCDS would provide a consistent means of publishing data.

The Chair explained that the scope of this standard would not include the Scottish Government or English local government but that, if the standard is approved by the Chair of the Open Standards Board, UK government would welcome adoption by devolved administrations and local government.

The Panel agreed that the standard could be of use in publishing local government contracting data. It noted that the LGA does offer a service to local authorities of guidance in publishing data. A panel member offered to meet with the challenge owner to discover how OCDS could map to the existing local authority schema.

The Chair asked if historic data would be published in this format. The answer was that this was not planned for the time being.

The panel asked questions related to the answers in the standard assessment.

The panel noted that the test tool available tested the syntax but not the content of the data which is in part freeform text.

The Panel resolved to recommended OCDS to the board, with a recommendation that they consider promoting this standard for use in local government.

Actions: Add to proposal a note on scope of data to be published confirming whether it is in line with the freedom of information act.

## International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)

The Challenge owner introduced the standard - The standard was developed to meet a need from developing countries to have available open data on aid given by donor countries such as the UK. The core need being transparency of what aid was received. The UK was the first county to use the IATI standard in 2011 and is now used worldwide. The standard is now at version 2.02. There are tools available to scrape and query the data.

The Chair asked who the standard developer is. The challenge owner advised that technical development is by Development Initiatives of the UK on behalf of the International Aid Transparency Initiative. A consortium of members funds the standard and it is published under the creative commons license.

Questions from the panel included -

* Is the data published in a form that allows processing. The challenge owner advised that the data is static information that can be transformed into dashboards etc.
* Are there third sector organisations (charities and voluntary) using this standard? The challenge owner advised that there are..
* The challenge owner explained what methods are available to organisations wanting to publish data using this standard. These include open source and web based tools.
* This is the only standard in this space;there is some linkage to OCDS however the IATI standard is specific to development data.
* The issue of compatibility of versions was tabled. The panel was informed that there are quite large differences between version 1.x and 2.x but the available tools can import data from both versions.
* There is guidance available to what data is published to deal with information that could pose a security risk.

The Panel agreed to recommend the IATI standard to the board

## AOB

There was a discussion of how to handle new standard version releases and the panel recommended that this subject should be discussed at the next board meeting.
