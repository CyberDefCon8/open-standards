This meeting was held to evaluate the following proposals:

*   Publishing vacancies online: JobPosting v2.1
*   Multi agency incident transfer (MAIT): Multi Agency Incident Transfer Version 0.2.2

## Declaration of interests

Peter Parslow declared a commercial interest in standards relating to geographic data such as UPRN as he is an employee of Ordnance Survey. UPRN is a product of GeoPlace a public sector limited liability partnership between the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey.

James Stewart declared that he is a UK government representative at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

## Summary of outcomes

The Data panel:

1. agreed that JobPosting 2.1 should be put forward to the Open Standards Board as a recommended rather than compulsory open standard for publishing vacancies online, once revisions have been made to the proposal.
2. deferred discussion of MAIT 0.2.2 to the next Panel meeting.

## Publishing vacancies online

The challenge owner explained the user need that led to the proposal and the benefits of the standard. Job seekers need vacancy postings that contain relevant and accurate information. Job aggregator and search providers require standardised data to re-use in their services and government departments require data that can be interchanged. The challenge owner proposed use of the JobPosting schema from schema.org to meet these needs.   

The Panel requested that the challenge owner makes clear in a revised proposal which organisations or functional areas should refer to this standards profile.

The Panel noted that this challenge deals with structured data for job advert posting and not to pre-filing of job applications. The Panel asked if any competitor standards exist. Two were discussed, a proprietary schema and ArgotVacancy which appears to be unsupported. 

The Panel discussed the need to standardise property values in the schema, as JobPosting allows for a variety of values to be used. For example, in ‘JobLocation’ the place values can be for example ‘PostalAddress’or ‘GeoCoordinates’, among others. The Panel considered that a standardised format would be needed to provide consistent data.

The Panel agreed that adopting a schema.org schema must not lead to unintentional adoption of the schema.org underlying structure and class model. The proposal needs to be clear that only the JobPosting definition from schema.org is being referred to, not any of the underlying classes.

The Panel decided to recommend that adopting this standard would be a positive step. However, other data standards would need to be agreed for the property values. The proposal should be updated to reflect that these are needed. The standard was thought to be too immature to adopt as a compulsory standard for government, therefore it was decided to recommend that it could be a voluntary standard with a review after one year.

### Actions relating to publishing vacancies online

* Challenge owner to revise the proposal to make clear which organisations or functional areas should refer to the proposed solution.  
* The proposal needs to be clear that only the JobPosting definition from schema.org is being referred to, not any of the underlying classes.  
* In the ‘Other steps to achieving interoperability’ section of the proposal, the challenge owner should describe the property values that will need to be standardised, referring to any that have already been adopted by the Open Standards Board and consider raising new challenge suggestions through the Standards Hub for any that have not yet been adopted.

## Multi agency incident transfer (MAIT)

The Panel deferred discussion of this proposal to another date when the challenge owner could be available.
