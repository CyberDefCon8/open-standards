This was the fifth Open Standards Board, two proposals were tabled for discussion:

1. Language tags
1. Country codes

A revised challenge on understanding government documents was also tabled. The Open Standards Board had previously asked for clarity on the scope and user need when they had been asked to review a proposal on this topic.

## Summary of outcomes

The Board agreed:

1. Understanding government documents is a good challenge to take through the process. The scope of the proposed challenge needs to be refined to clearly describe the user needs and two streams of work, one addressing the data elements and the other the vocabularies.
2. The secretariat should investigate copyright of ISO standards and their general interrelationship with IETF specifications. It should also investigate putting a request to ISO for them to consider making language tags and country codes publicly available specifications.
3. Subject to requested changes to the proposals, ISO 3166-1:2013 and ISO 639-1:2002 must be used in new systems handling data or web content that requires language tags or country codes.

## Declarations of interest

Before each meeting attendees are asked to declare any interests relating to the topics being covered. Several members declared affiliations to standards bodies such as W3C, ISO’s JTC1 and BSI. All of these are recorded in the Board members’ biographies. No Board members are directly connected with the standards committees responsible for ISO 3166 or ISO 639.

Paul Downey declared that in addition to being a board member, he is challenge owner for the two proposals under consideration.

## Discussion topic 1: new members and terms of reference

Magnus began the meeting by welcoming new Board members: Adrian Hepworth, Chris Francis and Daniel Appelquist.

He also welcomed back Matthew Dovey and Adam Cooper who had been successful in their re-application to the Board.

Magnus outlined the terms of reference for the Open Standards Board. The Board accepted these terms.

In answer to a question from the the board about the definition of open standards in this context and whether it was aligned with the OpenStand principles, Linda Humphries explained that the UK Government definition of open standards was set in HM Government’s Open Standards Principles following a full public consultation. It is broadly aligned with the OpenStand principles but the UK definition specifies Royalty Free rather than fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

## Discussion topic 2: understanding government documents challenge

Nicholas Oughtibridge presented this suggested challenge to the Board. Nicholas highlighted that this was to seek feedback before the challenge progresses. A previous challenge on this topic had reached proposal stage and was discussed at the [Open Standards Board in 2013](2013-05-09-open-standards-board).  The Board had requested that work was needed on the scope and user needs of the challenge and that a new proposal would be required based on a redefined challenge.

Nicholas explained the new suggested challenge was for lightweight metadata to allow decisions to be made on content, importance and security classification. Nicholas stated that in his view it should go through the triage panel again.

Magnus asked if there are open standards that can meet this need. The Board thought that there could be in part but some government defined vocabularies may also be required.  Government defined vocabularies fall outside of the Government’s open standards definition. Sustainability and support for vocabularies should be addressed as it passes through the Standards Hub process. The board thought lessons should be learnt from e-GMS (e-Government Metadata) Standard.

The Board discussed the scope in the new suggested challenge and agreed that it was too wide and needed to be scoped to focus on a clearly defined user need relating to archival use cases, ongoing storage and selection, rather than on broader hypothetical use cases relating to findability. These include:

* Officials who need to populate metadata so that records can be handled appropriately
* Developers building systems that manage government information

The challenge should relate to data rather than technical implementation and should include two parts:  the standard(s) for the metadata and the vocabularies. The Board agreed that with further work this would be a good challenge to take through the Standards Hub.

### Decision:

Nicholas and Anisha to work with The National Archives to refine the scope of the proposed challenge and to clearly describe two streams, one addressing the data elements and the other the vocabularies.

## Discussion topic 3: Language tag and country code proposals

Nicholas Oughtibridge presented the proposal to use ISO 639-1:2002 for the description of languages tags and ISO 3166-1:2013 for country codes.

Challenge owner Paul Downey explained that these challenges were a result of the outcome on the Public Emergency Alert Messaging  Public Emergency Alert Messaging challenge and the Board’s request for some standards referred to in the Common Alerting Protocol Common Alerting Protocol to be handled individually to reduce complexity.

Paul explained that country codes were widely available (eg on the ISO site and through wikipedia). Both language tags and country codes and already in use by GOV.UK. Paul gave the example of the British High Commision pages which are available in more than one language.

Nicholas Oughtibridge expressed the Data Panel's view that the standards met the assessment criteria but there were questions on the point of access to the ISO process by an individual and the need to pay for the specification.

## Openness

The Board discussed the openness of the process. National member bodies eg BSI can engage. BSI is open to individual membership, subject to a fee.

The ISO process does not document a publicly accessible review period and membership may create a barrier to engagement. The Board felt that more collaborative engagement would better align with the UK’s definition of open.

The Board agreed that the ISO standards for codes describing languages and countries would be acceptable to the Board in this case but that for any future challenges, if ISO standards are put forward, the openness will need to be carefully assessed on a case by case basis.

### Action:

Secretariat to investigate copyright of ISO standards and their general interrelationship with IETF specifications.

### Cost

Paul highlighted that there would not be a cost for implementing the codes as they are published freely by more than one source including, in the case of country codes, on the ISO website. There is however a cost to purchase the standards themselves.

The Board noted that the UK open standards principles does allow for a low cost to be associated with purchasing standards. It noted that there are no declared patents but the copyright terms are fairly restrictive.

The Board suggested that HM Government should put forward a case to ISO for language tags and country codes to be made publicly available specifications as they appear to fulfil the criteria that it is used and cited by other standards developers.

### Action:

Secretariat to investigate putting a request to ISO for language tags and country codes to be made publicly available specifications.

## UK versus GB in country codes

The Board discussed the proposal to divert from ISO 3166 by replacing GB with UK for country codes. The Board disagreed that UK should replace GB as this would fork the standard. It agreed that ISO 3166 must be used, but could be extended to include UK if that is required in an implementation, particularly as it is a reserved code and the European Commission also cites use of UK rather than GB.

### Action:

Paul Downey to amend the country codes proposal to remove reference to replacing GB with UK.

## Scope of the proposals

The scope of the proposals was questioned by the Board. The Board discussed that whereas the scope of the language tags proposal was clear and addressed only web publishing, the country code proposal was not so specific.

The Board debated the merits of each approach and decided that there is less complexity in systems if the same tags are used for data as well as web publishing. If there is a case where this is not the best approach, that could be handled through the exemption process.

### Action:

Paul Downey to amend the scope of the proposals so that whenever a language tag or country code is required in new systems, the selected standards must be used.

Decision:  The Board agreed with the proposals, subject to the requested changes. ISO 3166-1:2013 and ISO 639-1:2002 must be used in new systems handling data or content that requires language tags or country codes.

## Discussion topic 4: standards pipeline

Anisha Ahuja advised the board of the challenges currently in the standards pipeline.  There are currently three challenges to bring to the triage panel:

* Exchange of property information
* Exchange of location information
* Understanding government documents

There is also a challenge at proposal stage: quantities.

## Other business

Magnus Falk advised the board that the Public Emergency Alert Messaging update had been sent to the Board (annex A).  He outlined that the challenge owner was working with OASIS on a UK profile which should be ready for the next Open Standards board in October 2015.

Magnus highlighted that a proposed standards selection fast-track process was approved by the Minister of the Cabinet Office, this would be shared with the Board later on in the year for ratification.

Peter Counter, CTO at Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) had prepared a list of standards in use in the health sector that may be of use in other sectors and asked how these could be considered by the Board.

Action: Peter Counter to prepare suggested challenges so that the user needs and use cases can be considered through the triage panel.
