## Applicability
Does the formal specification address and facilitate interoperability between public administrations?

Does the formal specification address and facilitate the development of information or IT systems in government?

Are the functional and non-functional requirements for the use and implementation of the formal specification appropriately detailed?

Is the formal specification applicable and extensible for implementations in different domains?

Is the formal specification largely independent from products of single providers (either open source or proprietary)?

Is the formal specification largely independent from specific platforms?

Has the standard been written such that its realisation can be/is demonstrated using more than one technology (e.g. XML and JSON)?

## Maturity

Has the formal specification been sufficiently developed and in existence for a period to overcome most of its initial problems?

Are there existing or planned mechanisms to assess conformity of the implementations of the formal specification (e.g. conformity tests, certifications, plugfests etc)?

Has the formal specification sufficient detail, consistency and completeness for the use and development of products?

Does the formal specification provide available implementation guidelines and documentation for the implementation of products?

Does the formal specification provide a reference (or open source) implementation?

Does the formal specification address backward compatibility with previous versions?

Have the underlying technologies for implementing the formal specification been proven, stable and clearly defined?

## Openness
Is information on the terms and policies for the establishment and operation of the standardisation organisation publicly available?

Is participation in the creation process of the formal specification open to all relevant stakeholders (e.g. organisations, companies or individuals)?

Is information on the standardisation process publicly available?

Information on the decision making process for approving formal specifications is publicly available?

Are the formal specifications approved in a decision making process which aims at reaching consensus?

Are the formal specifications reviewed using a formal review process with all relevant external stakeholders (e.g. public consultation)?

All relevant stakeholders can formally appeal or raise objections to the development and approval of formal specifications?
Relevant documentation of the development and approval process of formal specifications is publicly available (e.g. preliminary results, committee meeting notes)?

Is the documentation of the formal specification publicly available for implementation and use at zero or low cost?

## Intellectual property rights
Is the documentation of the IPR for formal specifications publicly available (is there a clear and complete set of licence terms)?

Is the formal specification licensed on a royalty-free basis?

## Market support

Has the formal specification been used for different implementations by different vendors/suppliers?

Has the formal specification been used in different industries, business sectors or functions?

Has interoperability been demonstrated across different implementations by different vendors/suppliers?

Do the products that implement the formal specification have a significant market share of adoption?

Do the products that implement the formal specification target a broad spectrum of end-uses?

Has the formal specification a strong support from different interest groups?

## Potential
Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification supports improving efficiency and effectiveness of organisational process?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification makes it easier to migrate between different solutions from different providers?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification positively impacts the environment?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification positively impacts financial costs?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification positively impacts security?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification can be implemented alongside enterprise security technologies?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification positively impacts privacy?

Is the formal specification largely compatible with related (not alternative) formal specifications in the same area of application?

Is there evidence that the adoption of the formal specification positively impacts the accessibility and inclusion?
Does the formal specification have a defined maintenance organisation?

Does the maintenance organisation for the formal specification have sufficient finances and resources to be sure of freedom from short- to medium-term threats?

Does the maintenance organisation have a public statement on intention to transfer responsibility for maintenance of the formal specification if the organisation were no longer able to continue?

Does the formal specification have a defined maintenance and support process?

Does the formal specification have a defined policy for version management?

## Coherence
Is this an existing European standard or an identified technical specification in Europe? (Note: CEN, CENELEC and ETSI are the European standards bodies. Technical specifications provided by organisations other than CEN, CENELEC or ETSI can be under consideration to become a European standard or an identified technical specification in Europe for example through the Multi Stakeholder Platform.)

Does this specification or standard cover an area different from those already identified or currently under consideration as an identified European standard or specification?
